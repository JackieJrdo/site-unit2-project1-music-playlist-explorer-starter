      - [x] There should be visual feedback (such as the heart turning a different color) to show that the playlist has been unliked by the user.
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please film yourself liking and unliking:
      - [x] a playlist with a like count of 0
      - [x] a playlist with a non-zero like count

- [x] **Shuffle Songs**
  - [x] Enable users to shuffle the songs within a playlist using a shuffle button in the playlist's detail modal.
  - [x] When the shuffle button is clicked, the playlist's songs should display in a different order.

  - [x] When the page is refreshed or reloaded, a new random playlist is displayed
    - For example, navigating to the all playlists page and then back to the featured playlist page should result in a new random playlist being displayed
    - Note that because your algorithm will not be truly random, it is possible that the same playlist will feature twice in a row. 
    - [x] **VIDEO WALKTHROUGH SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:** In addition to showcasing the above features, for ease of grading, please show yourself refreshing the featured page more than once. 
  - [x] Application includes a navigation bar or some other mechanism such that users can navigate to the page with all playlists from the featured page and vice versa without using the browser's back and forward buttons.

### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The topics did prepare me for similar/simple versions of the assignment, and helped have a base understanding. I felt a little unprepared to complete some of the logic in populating/shuffling the songs in the playlist modal because. I had to have brushed up on some general coding practices to complete the shuffling and reading!

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would have incorporated the search, sort, and create/delete features. I think the way I have it now feels unfinished - although heavily styled. Since I also had the embedded Spotify songs in the footer, I would have loved to make those songs related to the playlist songs. So for example, I would have liked to be able to click on a song and have that change the spotify embed at the bottom to match that song.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

For my project demo, I think it went well overall since I had the majority of my code working for submission. I made sure to have playlists with likes already for the code submission as well. I definitely saw many more things in others presentation that I wanted to pick up. Another scholar had a python script to read from a Spotify generated csv of her personal top songs and had that populate into json! I would LOVE to learn from her to do that, because even if it is not necessary, I think its a neat (and more accurate) approach.

### Shout out

Shoutout to Lucia for debugging with me! Vercel and GitHub (b/c of codepath fork) was not being friendly! Also a shoutout to Oliver for helping debug when he was long done with his project!
